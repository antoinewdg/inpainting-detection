"Playground" for detection of image modifications by inpainting algorithms.

Can detect various methods such as the one used in Photoshop, but is specifically targeted (and performs better) 
at the patch based methods such as the one [presented in this IPOL article](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2015/136/).

## Documentation

This project has currently no documentation because I do not see anyone having an immediate use of it besides myself,
if you feel it could be of any use to you or have any question feel free to contact me.
